# Soil-Monitoring-Bot
Allocated theme for E-yantra Robotics Competition 2021-2022 

Soil is at the heart of agriculture and its quality directly affects the quality of the yield. While soil is regarded as the “fertile substrate” for agriculture, it is important to understand that a balance among mineral components, soil organic matter, air and water is essential for soil to make it suitable for agriculture.

Keeping the above scenario in mind, in eYRC 2021-22 we present the theme Soil Monitoring Bot (SM), as the name suggests this comprises a robot deployed to monitor the soil conditions within an agriculture field divided into various farmlands. The robot swiftly navigates through them and monitors the soil condition. It then goes to the storage unit and supplies the necessary mineral, nutrients, organic matter, etc. as required by the soil.

In this theme, the team will build the SM Bot to deploy it on an arena that is the abstraction of the agriculture field. The brain of the robot is powered by an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that controls its sensors, actuators and pick-place mechanism.

Major challenges and learnings in this theme include building the Soil Monitoring Bot from scratch using an FPGA. This FPGA based robot will be able to traverse the arena, sense the environment and pick-and-place the necessary supplies from the supply unit to the field. It will also use wired and wireless communication techniques. This theme will help teams build a sophisticated architecture using Verilog HDL and unveil the powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.
